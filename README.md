mirah-vim
=========

This is a simple vim plugin that gives you syntax highlighting for the [Mirah](http://www.mirah.org) programming language.

## Install

If you are not using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) then I strongly suggest you to do so. After installing it, or if you already have it installed, just clone this repo to your `~/.vim/bundle` directory.
